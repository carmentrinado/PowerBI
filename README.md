# Luxembourg’s Electricity Sector: Green Transition

The Luxembourgish government offers subsidies to install solar panels. In this project, we assumed the role of the GG Group, an imaginary data analytics agency, to simulate a real-world professional context.

At the request of the Administration de l’environnement (AEV), we are presenting the impact of these subsidies in the energy sector on Luxembourg and we’ll advocate for their continued implementation.
